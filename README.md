# Arduino Nano OV7670 Resistor Detection with YOLOv8

## Description:

- This project leverages an OV7670 camera sensor and an Arduino Nano to detect resistors using the powerful YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once v8) deep learning model. YOLOv8 efficiently analyzes captured images to identify resistors in real-time, making it suitable for various applications.

## Hardware Used:

- Arduino Nano
- OV7670 camera sensor module
- Breadboard and jumper wires
- Resistors (for testing)

## Software Used:

- Arduino IDE (https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
- OV7670 library (specific library download instructions will be provided in the Installation section)
- YOLOv8 model (pre-trained for resistor detection) \* YOLOv8 inference library (compatible with Arduino Nano, may require modifications) Installation:
- Download Arduino IDE: If you haven't already, download and install the Arduino IDE from the official website.
- Install OV7670 Library: The specific library you'll need depends on your camera module and desired functionality. Consult the documentation or search online for compatible libraries. Popular options include:
- OV7670 Arduino Library by Adafruit (https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-ov7670-camera-library-samd51/overview)
- OV7670 library by earlephil (https://github.com/topics/ov7670)
- Follow the library's installation instructions to add it to your Arduino IDE.
- Obtain YOLOv8 Model: Find a YOLOv8 model pre-trained for resistor detection. Consider searching for publicly available models online or training your own on a dataset of resistor images. Note: Downloading models from untrusted sources can be risky. Ensure you trust the source before proceeding.
- YOLOv8 Inference Library: Locate an Arduino Nano-compatible YOLOv8 inference library. This might involve modifying existing libraries or exploring custom implementations. The complexity will depend on the library's structure and your programming experience.
